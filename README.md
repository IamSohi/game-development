## 📘 Introduction

Back when I first got into programming and learned **Java**, I was excited — but something felt off. I could write code, but I didn’t feel *accomplished*. I knew the syntax, but had nothing tangible to show for it. It was just lines on a screen that only I (and my laptop) could understand.

Living with my parents, I couldn’t really share my enthusiasm — they didn’t understand what I had just learned. I needed something real.

## 🎯 The Goal: Build Something Tangible

Frustrated, I decided to build a game — something I could *see* and *share*. I had just started using a smartphone and played a lot of games. So I thought, why not create one myself?

### 🔧 The Setup

- Installed **Android Studio** on my old Windows laptop (2GB RAM).
- Constant crashes made development nearly impossible.
- Searched for optimizations and workarounds until it finally ran.

---

## 🚀 The Journey Begins

### 🕹️ First Games

- Followed tutorials to build a **“Hello World”** app on Android.
- Discovered **LibGDX**, built a simple **"Collect the Droplets"** game.
- Cloned **Flappy Bird** through a YouTube tutorial.

But I still didn’t feel satisfied. These weren’t *my* games.

## 🦆 The Duck Game Idea

An idea struck me: what if instead of a flying bird, it was a **duck swimming**? Users could **tilt their phones** to guide it through obstacles.

### 🖼️ Attempt #1

- Downloaded duck images and a blue background.
- Problem: the duck looked like it was *flying*, not swimming.
- Tried animating waves to simulate water — couldn’t get it right.
- Realized I wasn’t a graphic designer (yet 😅), so I ditched the duck.

---

## ⚽ Enter: The Ball

Settled on a **ball** as the protagonist.

- Less emotionally engaging, but easier to animate.
- Designed basic hurdles (thin poles).
- Used the phone’s tilt sensor for ball control.
- Built a **viewport** system: the camera scrolls, game ends if ball falls out of bounds.

---

## 🔬 Building the Game Engine

### 🧪 Physics with Box2D

- Collision with obstacles.
- Wall boundaries.
- Ball behavior on contact.

### 🎨 Graphics

- Tools: **GIMP**, **Inkscape** (no budget for Photoshop).
- (Yes, I tried cracked Photoshop — it crashed my laptop again. 😅)

### ⚙️ Game Logic

- Speed control for ball and camera.
- Game over conditions.
- Level designs.
- Scoring system.
- Ball upgrades (e.g., smaller ball moves through gaps easier).
- In-game currency and unlockables.

---

## 🧩 Final Touches

- Menu screens.
- Sound and royalty-free background music.
- Achievements and leaderboards.
- In-app purchases and ads.
- Game settings and customization.

---

## ☁️ Publishing the Game

Ready to launch — but then:

- Google Play required a **$25 publishing fee**.
- Didn’t have the money, nor did my parents.
- Got help through a friend’s friend’s credit card.
- Finally published the game!

---

## 📣 Marketing Efforts

- Learned marketing basics.
- Took online courses on Udacity.
- Created Facebook posts.
- Asked friends to download, review, and share.
- Played the game myself to generate ad revenue (yes, really 😅).

### 💥 Reality Check

- Marketing wasn’t working.
- Exams arrived, so I shifted focus to studies.
- Burnout hit after 6–7 months of solo development.

---

## ✅ The Real Win

I didn’t build a viral game — but I built something *real*.

I turned abstract syntax into a tangible, published product. That was always the goal.

> *"I didn’t set out to make the next big hit. I just wanted to prove to myself that I could build something from scratch — and I did."*

---

## 🌐 What’s Next?

I moved on to **web development** after that, and that opened up a whole new world.

But that’s a story for another day.

## 🙏 Thanks for Reading!

This project may be gone from Google Play now, but the journey — the persistence, the crashes, the problem-solving — that all lives on in me. And maybe in you now, too.
