# 💡 My First Experience with Perseverance (Game Development)

Back when I first got into programming and learned Java, I was excited—but something felt off. I could write code, sure, but I didn’t feel accomplished. I knew the syntax, but I had nothing to show for it. Just lines on a screen only I (and my laptop) could understand.

I lived with my parents, who didn’t really get what I was doing. I wanted to build something real—something I could point to and say, “Look, I made this.”

I didn’t know what to build. I just knew some Java. Around that time, I had just gotten a smartphone and was downloading all sorts of apps and games. That led to an idea: what if I built a game?

So I started with the basics—installed Android Studio on my poor old Windows laptop with 2GB of RAM. Big mistake. It crashed constantly.

But I wasn’t giving up. I looked up every trick I could find to make Android Studio run. Eventually, I got it to work. I followed some tutorials—got “Hello World” to show up on my phone, and then found the LibGDX library. I followed a tutorial and built a basic game called "Collect the Droplets." Then I built a Flappy Bird clone from YouTube.

Still, something felt missing. I couldn’t publish those games—they were just copies. I needed something original.

That’s when my overthinking kicked in. I had an idea: instead of a bird flying, what if it was a duck swimming? The user would tilt the phone to help the duck pass through obstacles. I downloaded duck images, added a blue background—and instantly it looked like the duck was flying in the sky, not swimming. Not ideal.

To fix that, I tried adding waves to simulate water. I wasn’t a designer, and I’d just learned Java—so animating water was tough. After failing to get it right, I ditched the duck.

I replaced it with a ball.

Not as cute or funny, but at least it made sense. I could build mechanics around tilting the phone to move the ball, dodging hurdles, and trying to stay within the screen bounds. I added poles as obstacles, a moving camera, and started learning Box2D for physics. The ball couldn’t pass through walls, and it would stop if it hit a hurdle.

Next, I had to figure out graphics. No money for Photoshop—so I used GIMP and Inkscape. (Yeah, I tried installing cracked Photoshop. My laptop didn’t survive that attempt.)

Then came the logic: how fast should the ball move? What happens when the player wins or loses? How do you score? I added different levels, ball upgrades (small balls can pass easier), and even in-game currency to unlock features.

Eventually, I built something playable.

But now came testing. I remember one time my laptop froze for two hours, and I just sat there, afraid to restart because I hadn’t saved my code.

Still, I kept going—debugging, fixing, tweaking. Eventually, the game felt right. But it loaded slow. So I learned about optimization—sprite sheets, pixel-perfect coordinates, better asset management. Bit by bit, it improved.

Finally, I added music, in-app purchases, ads (because why not make a little money), sharing features, leaderboards, achievements, settings—you name it.

I was ready to publish. Then came the $25 Google Play fee. I didn’t have the money, and neither did my parents. But my dad’s friend’s friend had a credit card. I paid the fee and published the game.

Success?

Not really. Nobody knew it existed.

So I learned marketing. Took courses. Promoted on Facebook. Asked friends to leave reviews. I even played the game myself to generate a few cents from ads.

But nothing really worked. Then exams hit. I paused everything to study. After exams, I felt drained. I had achieved my real goal: publish something tangible.

That was it.

I expected the game to take off, but honestly, that was never the true mission. I just wanted to build something and get it out into the world. And I did.

Could I have done more? Maybe. But after 6–7 months, I was burned out and ready for a new chapter—web development.

But that’s a story for another day.
